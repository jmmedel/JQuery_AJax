    If you have a block of jQuery code
     which uses the $ shortcut and you
      do not want to change it all, you 
      can pass the $ sign in as a parameter
       to the ready method. This allows you
        to access jQuery using $, inside this
         function - outside of it, you will have
          to use "jQuery":
