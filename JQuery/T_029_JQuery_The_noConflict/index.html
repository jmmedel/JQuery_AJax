jQuery - The noConflict() Method
What if you wish to use other frameworks on your pages, while still using jQuery?

jQuery and Other JavaScript Frameworks
As you already know; jQuery uses the $ sign as a shortcut for jQuery.

There are many other popular JavaScript frameworks like: Angular, Backbone, Ember, Knockout, and more.

What if other JavaScript frameworks also use the $ sign as a shortcut?

If two different frameworks are using the same shortcut, one of them might stop working.

The jQuery team have already thought about this, and implemented the noConflict() method.

The jQuery noConflict() Method
The noConflict() method releases the hold on the $ shortcut identifier, so that other scripts can use it.

You can of course still use jQuery, simply by writing the full name instead of the shortcut:

-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script>
$.noConflict();
jQuery(document).ready(function(){
    jQuery("button").click(function(){
        jQuery("p").text("jQuery is still working!");
    });
});
</script>
</head>
<body>

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<button>Test jQuery</button>

</body>
</html>
