    We could also have added more method calls if needed.

Tip: When chaining, the line of code could become quite long. However, jQuery is not very strict on the syntax; you can format it like you want, including line breaks and indentations.

This also works just fine:

-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script>
$(document).ready(function(){
    $("button").click(function(){
        $("#p1").css("color", "red")
            .slideUp(2000)
            .slideDown(2000);
    });
});
</script>
</head>
<body>

<p id="p1">jQuery is fun!!</p>

<button>Click me</button>

</body>
</html>

<!-- 
    
    jQuery throws away extra whitespace and executes the lines above as one long line of code.
