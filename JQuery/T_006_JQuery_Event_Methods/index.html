    jQuery Event Methods

    jQuery is tailor-made to respond to events in an HTML page.

What are Events?
All the different visitor's actions that a web page can respond to are called events.

An event represents the precise moment when something happens.

Examples:

moving a mouse over an element
selecting a radio button
clicking on an element
The term "fires/fired" is often used with events. Example: "The keypress event is fired, the moment you press a key".

Here are some common DOM events:

Mouse Events	Keyboard Events	Form Events	Document/Window Events
click	keypress	submit	load
dblclick	keydown	change	resize
mouseenter	keyup	focus	scroll
mouseleave	 	blur	unload

jQuery Syntax For Event Methods
In jQuery, most DOM events have an equivalent jQuery method.

To assign a click event to all paragraphs on a page, you can do this:

$("p").click();
The next step is to define what should happen when the event fires. You must pass a function to the event:

$("p").click(function(){
  // action goes here!!
});


Commonly Used jQuery Event Methods
$(document).ready()

The $(document).ready() method allows us to execute a function when the document is fully loaded. This event is already explained in the jQuery Syntax chapter.

click()

The click() method attaches an event handler function to an HTML element.

The function is executed when the user clicks on the HTML element.

The following example says: When a click event fires on a <p> element; hide the current <p> element:

-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script>
$(document).ready(function(){
    $("p").click(function(){
        $(this).hide();
    });
});
</script>
</head>
<body>

<p>If you click on me, I will disappear.</p>
<p>Click me away!</p>
<p>Click me too!</p>

</body>
</html>
