    Add Several New Elements With append() and prepend()
In both examples above, we have only inserted some text/HTML at the beginning/end of the selected HTML elements.

However, both the append() and prepend() methods can take an infinite number of new elements as parameters. The new elements can be generated with text/HTML (like we have done in the examples above), with jQuery, or with JavaScript code and DOM elements.

In the following example, we create several new elements. The elements are created with text/HTML, jQuery, and JavaScript/DOM. Then we append the new elements to the text with the append() method (this would have worked for prepend() too) :

-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script>
function appendText() {
    var txt1 = "<p>Text.</p>";              // Create text with HTML
    var txt2 = $("<p></p>").text("Text.");  // Create text with jQuery
    var txt3 = document.createElement("p");
    txt3.innerHTML = "Text.";               // Create text with DOM
    $("body").append(txt1, txt2, txt3);     // Append new elements
}
</script>
</head>
<body>

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<button onclick="appendText()">Append text</button>

</body>
</html>
