jQuery - AJAX get() and post() Methods
The jQuery get() and post() methods are used to request data from the server with an HTTP GET or POST request.

HTTP Request: GET vs. POST
Two commonly used methods for a request-response between a client and server are: GET and POST.

GET - Requests data from a specified resource
POST - Submits data to be processed to a specified resource
GET is basically used for just getting (retrieving) some data from the server. Note: The GET method may return cached data.

POST can also be used to get some data from the server. However, the POST method NEVER caches data, and is often used to send data along with the request.

To learn more about GET and POST, and the differences between the two methods, please read our HTTP Methods GET vs POST chapter.

jQuery $.get() Method
The $.get() method requests data from the server with an HTTP GET request.

Syntax:

$.get(URL,callback);
The required URL parameter specifies the URL you wish to request.

The optional callback parameter is the name of a function to be executed if the request succeeds.

The following example uses the $.get() method to retrieve data from a file on the server:

-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script>
$(document).ready(function(){
    $("button").click(function(){
        $.get("demo_test.asp", function(data, status){
            alert("Data: " + data + "\nStatus: " + status);
        });
    });
});
</script>
</head>
<body>

<button>Send an HTTP GET request to a page and get the result back</button>

</body>
</html>


<!--

    The first parameter of $.get() is the URL we wish to request ("demo_test.asp").

The second parameter is a callback function. The first callback parameter holds the content of the page requested, and the second callback parameter holds the status of the request.

Tip: Here is how the ASP file looks like ("demo_test.asp"):

<%
response.write("This is some text from an external ASP file.")
%>
